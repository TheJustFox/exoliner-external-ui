# Exoliner External UI
An external executor made for roblox serverside executor [exoliner.wtf](https://exoliner.wtf) using c# and winforms.

This is my first actual github project, if you have any suggestions you can open [issue](https://github.com/TheJustFox/exoliner-external-ui/issues) or something (😭).

# Features
- Tab system
- Colored editor (using FastColoredTextbox)
- File save/load
- Offline script hub
- Auto execute
- Shortcuts
- Payload (code before every executed script)

This project can be probably used with other serversides by doing some tweaks to ExolinerWrapper.cs
